// TODOS:

0- Complete a working example of the task. Refactor later on.
1- Retry mechanism for the endpoints returning 500
2- Integration testing with Nock
3- Refactor CI setup with GitHub Actions
4- Maybe instead of basic retry mechanism, we can also demonstrate circuit breakers
5- Convert it to a CLI that gets the API key as an argument
6- Add docs for setting up the dev env and running the app (don't forget .nvmrc)
